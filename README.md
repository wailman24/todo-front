This Flutter application is connected to a To-Do API that I built during the web challenge. The app allows users to:

✔️ Add tasks
✔️ Mark tasks as completed
✔️ Delete tasks
✔️ Sync tasks with the backend API

🔗 Backend API
The Flutter app communicates with a Node.js API that I developed in the web challenge. The API handles:

User authentication 
CRUD operations for tasks
Data storage
🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB 
🚀 How It Works
The app fetches tasks from the backend API.
Users can add, update, or delete tasks.
Any changes sync with the API in real-time.
